            <p>Kuro "KuroKy" Salehi Takhasomi is a professional Dota 2 player who is currently playing for Team Liquid. </p><br/>
            <p>KuroKy currently grew up in Berlin, Germany.[1] KuroKy suffered from disabilities to his legs, and would 
                struggle to use his legs. He stated that this weakness was what led to him to play video games. </p><br/>
            <h3>DotA</h3>  <br/>              
            <p>KuroKy played for a few German DotA teasms before joining his first international team, mousesports, where he played with players such as Drayich. This mousesports lineup attended DreamHack Winter 2008 with Puppey acting as stand-in; this was to be the beginning of a long relationship between KuroKy and Puppey. KuroKy then joined Ks.int, which at one point had a total number of 9 players and looked more like a mix than an actual team.
                 Some well known players in the DotA scene were on the team, such as Puppey, Vigoss and LevenT. </p><br/>
            <h3>Dota 2</h3><br/>
            <p>KuroKy's first public appearance in Dota 2 was The International 2011 along with the game's debut at Gamescom. He participated in the tournament under GosuGamers.net with teammates Kebap, Azen, and Mirakel. Unfortunately for them, they dropped all three group stage games and were eliminated by MiTH.
